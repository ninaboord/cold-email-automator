Hi {their first name},

My name is Jane Doe and I'm a senior at Stanford studying Computer Science. I'm a builder and an aspiring Founder.

I saw you were a {current role} at {current company}. {IF you find the mission of the company, you can add "I love your mission to {mission}" otherwise, leave it out.} {IF the person is a Stanford alumnus, add the sentence "I saw you also went to Stanford!" otherwise, leave it out.} {IF this person is a woman, continue the sentence with a comma and add "and I always love to speak with other female founders." Otherwise, leave it out.} I'd love to hear about your journey founding {current company}. I had a few questions specifically about how you fundraised and found investors who you felt could be partners. {IF this person worked at an interesting tech company in the past (i.e. a startup or large, well-known company), choose the most compelling one or the one that they spent the most time at and add the sentence "I'm also curious about your experience at {company} and how it informed where you are today."}

I appreciate your time and I know it is valuable. If you are interested, you can book a quick meeting at your leisure at calendly.com/janedoe. I'm looking forward to getting to know you, and I'm excited to find out how our goals might align.

Warmly,
Jane

When you are done writing the email, go over it one more time and make sure that it is clear, concise, and makes sense. I want to send the email exactly how it is. Your response should ONLY contain the email. Do NOT add a subject line.
